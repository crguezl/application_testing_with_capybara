Application Testing with Capybara - Code Examples

Installation
------------

As far as possible the examples will run locally but some require access to the internet.

In order to run the examples you will need to place the html directory (containing the example web pages) under the document root of a webserver of your choice, so long as your webserver allows directory listing you should then be able to navigate to http://localhost/html and see all the demo html files ordered by chapter.

To install the required Gems for the Ruby code run 'bundle install' in the root directory (assuming you have ruby, rubygems and the Bundler gem available).

The cucumber tests can then be run by simply running 'bundle exec cucumber'.

Note - the examples may differ slightly from the book as sometimes it made more sense to leave debug output in the code to make things more visible when you run the examples where in the book assertions may have been used.
